# Image Validation Test Plan

## Changes Made
1. ✅ Added image validation to `validateForm()` function
2. ✅ Added required asterisk (*) to "Item Photo" label
3. ✅ Updated image upload area to show error states (red border, red background)
4. ✅ Added error message display below image upload area
5. ✅ Clear image error when valid image is uploaded
6. ✅ Show error when image is removed

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Form Submission Without Image
1. Navigate to Add Listing page
2. Fill in all required fields (name, description, price, category)
3. Do NOT upload an image
4. Try to submit the form
5. **Expected**: Form should not submit, image upload area should show red error state, error message should appear

### Test 2: Upload Valid Image
1. Start with form in error state (no image)
2. Upload a valid image (PNG, JPG, JPEG under 2MB)
3. **Expected**: Error state should clear, image preview should show, error message should disappear

### Test 3: Remove Image After Upload
1. Upload a valid image
2. Click the X button to remove the image
3. **Expected**: Image should be removed, error state should appear again

### Test 4: Drag and Drop
1. Drag a valid image file over the upload area
2. **Expected**: Upload area should show hover state, then process the image

### Test 5: Invalid File Types
1. Try to upload non-image files
2. **Expected**: Toast error message should appear, form should remain in error state

## UI Improvements
- Image upload area now shows clear visual feedback when image is required
- Red border and background when in error state
- Updated text to "Photo Required!" when in error state
- Consistent error styling with other form fields
- Error message with icon for better UX
